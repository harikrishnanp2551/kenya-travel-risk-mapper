# Kenya Travel Risk Mapper

This project was developed during my visit to Kenya for an afforestation project, which inspired the creation of this tool to identify safe travel routes in areas with active reforestation.

The **Kenya Travel Risk Mapper** is a project designed to identify areas in Kenya with lower conflict levels and evaluate whether reforestation zones are safe for travel. This tool can be especially useful for auditors and professionals who rely on government travel advisories to support their work and ensure safe travel routes.

## Introduction

This repository hosts the code and data for mapping travel risks across Kenya. By analyzing conflict data and reforestation areas, the project helps identify safe travel corridors and regions with minimal conflict. The output can guide auditors and decision-makers who need to verify travel advisories issued by the government.

## Project Motivation

Travel safety in regions with potential conflicts is a critical concern. With Kenya undergoing significant reforestation efforts, ensuring that these areas and the surrounding regions are safe for travel is essentialâ€”especially for professionals conducting audits and field inspections. This project combines conflict data with environmental and advisory data to:
- Highlight zones with reduced conflict.
- Identify reforestation areas where travel is considered safe.
- Provide a visual tool that supports data-driven travel decisions.

## Features

- **Conflict Analysis:** Identifies and maps areas with low conflict intensity.
- **Reforestation Safety Check:** Evaluates the safety of reforestation areas for travel.
- **Visual Mapping:** Provides an interactive map visualization to easily spot safe and risky regions.
- **Data Integration:** Combines multiple data sources including government travel advisories and conflict data for comprehensive risk assessment.

## Data Sources

- **Conflict Data:** Sources detailing recent and historical conflicts in Kenya.
- **Government Travel Advisories:** Official advisories outlining travel safety and risk.
- **Reforestation Zones:** Geographic data outlining key reforestation areas in Kenya.

*Note: Please ensure that you have access to the relevant data files or APIs mentioned in your analysis.*


## Usage

The main analysis and mapping are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `kenya_travel_risk.ipynb`. To run the project:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook kenya_travel_risk.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the Notebook Cells:**
   - Execute the cells sequentially.
   - Review the code, data import, analysis, and interactive map generation.
   - Modify parameters if needed to tailor the risk mapping to different regions or data updates.
